# 2v2-Chess-Game
Created a 2v2 chess game that implements basic object-oriented programming concepts in Java. The game can be played by running the GameApp class on any IDE. The GUI was developed using Java Swing. A number of GUI Event Handlers were implemented as well.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97905386/162581336-b83055ae-83a6-4421-bc22-2dd7813353c5.png)
